Reviewer TqqW identifies the need for broader dataset testing and clearer resource usage comparisons, which are practical suggestions for strengthening the paper's impact. Reviewer pSht points out the weakness of the baseline comparison and the practical limitations of the dynamic programming algorithm, suggesting more relevant benchmarks and further discussion of optimization time. Reviewer GU1Q provides the most detailed critique, pinpointing missing implementation details, insufficient related work discussions, and a lack of qualitative comparisons. All reviews offer specific, actionable feedback aimed at refining both the methodology and the presentation of the research. Overall the reviewers constructively guide the authors in enhancing the paper's rigor and impact.\",\n",

Reviewers employ formal academic language appropriate for reviewing a research paper. The tone is objective and respectful, avoiding personal bias or emotional language. Each review is written in a manner that is easy to understand and follows a logical structure, facilitating effective communication of the reviewers' assessments. There are only minor instances of slightly awkward phrasing, but overall, the language quality and professionalism are of high standard throughout the reviews.\",\n",
      "  \"internal_consistency_paragraph\": \"The reviews exhibit good internal consistency, with each reviewer providing a coherent assessment that aligns with their stated strengths, weaknesses, and questions. Reviewer TqqW acknowledges the novelty of the approach while also pointing out specific areas for improvement, like more dataset diversity and resource analysis. Reviewer pSht appreciates the novel perspective on step sizes but raises concerns about the baseline comparison and practical implementation, leading to a coherent overall critique. Reviewer GU1Q values the interesting formulation of the problem but notes significant missing details and incomplete methodology sections. There is a clear link between the identified strengths and weaknesses within each review. Each review presents a cohesive and consistent evaluation of the paper, suggesting a sound understanding of the presented work by the reviewer. While the numerical scores may vary, the justifications align with the ratings and the presented arguments are cohesive with the stated confidence levels.\"\n",
