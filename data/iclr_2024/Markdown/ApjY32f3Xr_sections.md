## Abstract

While significant progress has been made on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a comprehensive comparison of these

## Introduction

Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are of paramount importance in science and engineering, as they often underpin our understanding of intricate physical systems such as fluid flow, heat transfer, and stress distribution (Morton & Mayers, 2005). The computational simulation of PDE systems has been a focal point of research for an extensive period, leading to the development of numerical
