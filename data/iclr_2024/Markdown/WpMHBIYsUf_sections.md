## Introduction

In the past few years, the field of computer vision has witnessed significant advancements due to the development of deep learning networks, which have surpassed the performance of traditional computer vision techniques. The well-developed deep neural network architectures such as GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al., 2014), VGGNet (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014), ResNet (He et al., 2016), and DarkNet53 (Redmon & Farhadi, 2018) are served as the fundamental component for building new networks for various tasks such as speech recognition (Hinton et al., 2012), image recognition (LeCun et al., 1998), and machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014), achieving great success. However, the fixed architectures of the these networks limits the networksâ€™ capability. For the object detection task, most of previous
